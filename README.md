# hello-world
my first rep in github
Hi, i'm brand new and beginner in coding. But I want to understand how it works, and i started a training about big data, even if i'm almost 50....Installing docker on my personnal computer was not so easy, learning R langage needed many efforts, but i did it, amongst other things. Now, i want to use open source data, for personnal use, just to learn. I decided to use http://www.aishub.net/ as i've been working in SC, i sent an email and received infos 
#Please stream your data via UDP to:
#Host: data.aishub.net (144.76.105.244)
#UDP port: 2840
#Send me a message when you start streaming and I will create your AISHub account.

but i don't know yet what to do with it....i want to pick up daily info and put them in a NoSQL system. That's where i am, and i thought i would find tutos on GitHub
